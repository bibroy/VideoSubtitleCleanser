1
00:00:02,019 --> 00:00:05,460
What is happening is we'll just go on the screenshot.

2
00:00:23,120 --> 00:00:26,110
Uh, reset, see, the reset year was successful.

3
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:28,440
Hm.

4
00:00:37,930 --> 00:01:02,470
So when, when we initially called the API during the first API call for the reset, uh, what happens is, uh, the course, uh, the, the course which we, uh, the school which, uh, we deleted, uh, where the course was assigned, so that one doesn't get added. But when we do this, uh, do it a second time, it is added properly. So that is the

5
00:01:02,470 --> 00:01:43,540
issue. One minute, one minute. So, so what is the uh functionality here? What should be the functionality here? Say you you have assigned the first you added the course to a school, then you reassociated the school to the course to another school. Both were created by the or added by the verifier. So now you are uh deleting the second school. So after deletion of the second school when you are not resetting, so what will happen to the course? Where will it get associated because the association is gone now for that course.

6
00:01:45,919 --> 00:01:55,970
So what will happen? So the course in essentially gets deleted when we delete the school. But when we do a reset, the idea is deleted

7
00:01:55,970 --> 00:01:58,339
or the association gets deleted.

8
00:01:58,830 --> 00:02:00,669
School uh the course also gets deleted.

9
00:02:02,470 --> 00:02:08,779
So with this example, I mean, we can try with this one, so I think.

10
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:26,889
Would it be like this or is a um in a database, it is like this because the course isn't the course an independent entity, uh, independent of the school because you can reassociate to any school.

11
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:35,339
Yeah, but, uh, hm, but, uh, where will that course uh be assigned then? In

12
00:02:35,339 --> 00:02:39,679
the, in the course list shouldn't it be there?

13
00:02:40,550 --> 00:02:55,910
Uh, we can check that. Uh, we can try it. Uh, I'm, uh, I also got confused now. Uh, so, uh, your question is valid. I, I just, uh, got confused. I, what is the ID? 5773.

14
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:02,500
Hm

15
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,240
2024. I'll select this one.

16
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:31,970
This is a test now.

17
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:34,559
And I

18
00:03:54,179 --> 00:03:58,470
Currently, no schools are added by uh verified, right? So I'll add one school.

19
00:04:29,059 --> 00:04:34,269
And uh so you are allocated 100% to this project or you're working on other project also?

20
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:49,549
No, I have um the, the allocation, but I don't know, but uh I'm given some APT tasks from um Agus for schools also. Uh, I think 5656 tickets uh are there.

21
00:04:50,119 --> 00:04:52,829
OK, so you are switching based on the tickets.

22
00:04:53,519 --> 00:04:54,029
Yes.

23
00:05:01,739 --> 00:05:02,730
OK.

24
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:11,160
So we have these courses, right? We'll select one of um course name computer. We'll select this one.

25
00:05:14,260 --> 00:05:17,540
Oh school, Academy of Computer Technology. OK.

26
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:22,140
Do a reassociation with Alaska Bible.

27
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,799
OK.

28
00:05:28,510 --> 00:05:29,079
I see.

29
00:05:35,839 --> 00:05:46,950
Now, I need to go ahead and delete. Firstly, we'll check if that course was added to Alaska. Yeah. We have it.

30
00:05:49,059 --> 00:05:51,609
Um, to go and delete Alaska Bible.

31
00:05:53,149 --> 00:05:53,380
OK.

32
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:59,510
OK. What happened to that course?

33
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:06,890
See, the course uh also got deleted.

34
00:06:09,149 --> 00:06:15,760
There's no computer courses. Now, what I do, what I'll do is I'll click on reset.

35
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:27,260
So yeah Um Yeah, only the associated courses are there. So how, so every

36
00:06:27,260 --> 00:06:28,579
day they do soft delete.

37
00:06:30,839 --> 00:06:30,850
Mm.

38
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:37,000
So now I'll uh call this reset functionality.

39
00:06:42,609 --> 00:06:47,839
OK. If you see, there was no computer course added, right? In the response also you'll see.

40
00:06:57,220 --> 00:06:59,420
Is it there? I don't see it.

41
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:01,709
This is the school name.

42
00:07:02,480 --> 00:07:09,079
Uh, this is a school name. That is fine. Uh, we don't see that computer course here. So now I'll do a reset again.

43
00:07:13,880 --> 00:07:36,339
See, the course gets added now. So this is the issue. You can use this ID which is mentioned in the Uh, take it and try to analyze why this is happening. You got it, right? So first time. The course was not available, but 2nd time. It is a

44
00:07:39,750 --> 00:07:42,459
Can you please just uh reiterate the thing uh.

45
00:07:44,910 --> 00:08:30,059
So, uh, uh, so you got the scenario, right? How, how to reproduce this? Well, so about the reset button. So what reset does is, so there's a separate table from where it just, uh, takes, uh, whatever the initial data was and adds to our, uh, uh, I mean the mod uh database. So that is what uh the reset functionality does. But currently what is happening is when we click on reset. And, uh, try to, uh, check like uh if the courses are reset properly. So in for the first click, it is not happening, but for the second time it is happening. The reset is working properly for the second instance, not for the 1st. So that

46
00:08:30,059 --> 00:08:35,849
is the we have to check the payload is going in the first reset and the reset

47
00:08:39,250 --> 00:09:32,549
is fine. See, in the payload we just have application here, nothing much. Oh, OK. See, there's the IED an application here. So, uh, basically, uh, just need to confirm what uh is different, uh different in both the request uh from. Uh Uh, you can just check the locks. So you'll find uh uh where exactly uh that particular lamb is. I'm also not sure. So you can just go through the code, try to check based on the uh API uh based on this API coursework API, what exactly is going wrong. And then you can just add a comment in the ticket uh mentioning uh this can be the issue or uh if you don't, don't find it, just text me like whatever your observation is.

48
00:09:34,260 --> 00:09:34,789
OK.

49
00:09:35,960 --> 00:09:36,719
Got it, right?

50
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:37,559
Mhm,

51
00:09:37,719 --> 00:09:38,030
yeah.

52
00:09:39,609 --> 00:09:45,559
OK then, uh, uh, before you log out, just, uh, uh, just let me know. I mean, whatever.

53
00:09:45,650 --> 00:09:46,859
Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.

54
00:09:47,719 --> 00:09:49,159
OK, fine. Thanks.

55
00:09:50,219 --> 00:09:51,630
Oh yeah, thank you. Bye.
