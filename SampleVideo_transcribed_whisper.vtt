cue1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:23.720
So what is happening is we will just go with the screenshot.

cue2
00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:47.720
So when we initially called the first API call for the reset, what happens is the course,

cue3
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.720
the course which we deleted where the course was assigned. So that one doesn't get added.

cue4
00:00:55.720 --> 00:01:02.720
But when we do this, do it second time, it is added properly. So that is the issue.

cue5
00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:15.720
One minute one minute. So what is the function here? What should be the function here? Say you have assigned the first you added the course to a school.

cue6
00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:21.720
Then you will associated the school to the course to another school.

cue7
00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:31.720
Both were created by the or added by the verifier. So now you are deleting the second school.

cue8
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:43.720
So after deletion of the second school, when you are not resetting, so what will happen to the course where we will get associated because the association is gone now for that course.

cue9
00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:45.720
So what will happen?

cue10
00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:51.720
So the course is essentially gets deleted when we delete the school.

cue11
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.720
But when we do a reset, the idea is.

cue12
00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:58.720
Or deleted or the association is deleted.

cue13
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.720
School the course also gets deleted.

cue14
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:08.720
So this example, I mean we can try with this one.

cue15
00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:26.720
Could it be like this or is a in a database it is like this because the course isn't the course and independent entity independent of the school because you can re associate to any school.

cue16
00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:29.720
Yeah, but the association should go.

cue17
00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:34.720
But where will that course be assigned then?

cue18
00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.720
So that is in the course list.

cue19
00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:40.720
In the course list shouldn't it be there?

cue20
00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:43.720
We can check that we can try it.

cue21
00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:46.720
I am also got confused now.

cue22
00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.720
So your question is valid.

cue23
00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.720
I just got confused.

cue24
00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.720
Why what is the idea?

cue25
00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.720
5773.

cue26
00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:30.720
2024 will select this one.

cue27
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.720
This is a test.

cue28
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:35.720
I.

cue29
00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:56.720
Currently no schools are added by very fat.

cue30
00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:59.720
So I will add one school.

cue31
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:35.720
And so you allocated 100% to this project you're working on another project also.

cue32
00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.720
No, I have the allocation, but I don't know.

cue33
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:44.720
But I'm given some APD tasks from amcass for schools also.

cue34
00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:49.720
I think of 5 or 6 5 or 6 tickets are there.

cue35
00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:53.720
Okay, so you are switching based on the tickets.

cue36
00:04:53.720 --> 00:05:03.720
Okay.

cue37
00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:13.720
So we have this courses right will select one of course name computer will select this one.

cue38
00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:18.720
School academy of computer technology.

cue39
00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:25.720
Do a reassociation with Alaska Bible.

cue40
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:27.720
Okay.

cue41
00:05:27.720 --> 00:05:35.720
It was safe.

cue42
00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.720
Now I need to go ahead and delete.

cue43
00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.720
Firstly we'll check if that course was added to Alaska Bible.

cue44
00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:48.720
Yeah, we have it.

cue45
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.720
To go and delete Alaska Bible.

cue46
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:04.720
Say okay, what happened to that course.

cue47
00:06:04.720 --> 00:06:08.720
See the course also got deleted.

cue48
00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.720
There's no computer course.

cue49
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:18.720
Now what I do what I'll do is click on reset.

cue50
00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:21.720
Yeah.

cue51
00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:24.720
Yeah, only the associated courses are there.

cue52
00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:32.720
So how so when you they do soft delete.

cue53
00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:42.720
So you know I call this reset functionality.

cue54
00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:56.720
Okay, if you see there was no computer course added right in the response also you will see.

cue55
00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:58.720
Is it there?

cue56
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.720
I don't see it.

cue57
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.720
This is a school name.

cue58
00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.720
This is a school name that is fine.

cue59
00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.720
We don't see that computer course here.

cue60
00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:13.720
So now I'll do a reset again.

cue61
00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.720
See the course gets added now.

cue62
00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:18.720
So this is the issue.

cue63
00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:27.720
You can use this ID which is mentioned in the ticket and try to analyze why this is happening.

cue64
00:07:27.720 --> 00:07:31.720
So first time the course was not available.

cue65
00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:39.720
But it's second time it is there.

cue66
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:44.720
Can you please just re-act the thing.

cue67
00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:50.720
So so you got the scenario right how to reproduce this.

cue68
00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.720
So about the reset button.

cue69
00:07:52.720 --> 00:08:04.720
So what reset does is so there's a separate table from where it just takes whatever the initial data was and adds to our.

cue70
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.720
I mean the more database so that is what the reset functionality does.

cue71
00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.720
But currently what is happening is when we click on reset.

cue72
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:19.720
And try to check like if the courses are reset properly.

cue73
00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:22.720
So in for the first click it is not happening.

cue74
00:08:22.720 --> 00:08:24.720
But for the second time it is happening.

cue75
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.720
The reset is working properly for the second instance not for the first.

cue76
00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:35.720
So that is the we have to check the whatever payload is going in the first reset and the second reset.

cue77
00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:38.720
The payload is fine.

cue78
00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:44.720
See in the payload we just have application here nothing much.

cue79
00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.720
Okay.

cue80
00:08:45.720 --> 00:08:48.720
Just ID and application here.

cue81
00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:53.720
So basically just need to confirm what is different.

cue82
00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.720
Different in both the request from.

cue83
00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.720
You can just check the locks.

cue84
00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.720
So you will find where exactly that particular lambdas I'm also not sure.

cue85
00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:16.720
So you can just go through the code try to check based on the API based on this API course of a P.

cue86
00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:19.720
What exactly is going wrong.

cue87
00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:26.720
And then you can just add a comment in the ticket mentioning this can be the issue.

cue88
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:33.720
Or if you don't find it just text me like whatever your observation is.

cue89
00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:35.720
Okay.

cue90
00:09:35.720 --> 00:09:38.720
What did right.

cue91
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:40.720
Okay then.

cue92
00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:45.720
Before you log out just just let me know I mean whatever.

cue93
00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:47.720
Yeah, yeah, sure.

cue94
00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:49.720
Okay, thanks.

cue95
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.720
Yeah, thank you.
