Dialogue: 0,0:00:23.04,0:00:26.09,Default,,0,0,0,,Uh, reset, see, the reset year was successful.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:27.98,0:00:28.98,Default,,0,0,0,,Hm.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:37.90,0:00:42.09,Default,,0,0,0,,So when, when we initially call that API during the first API
Dialogue: 0,0:00:42.09,0:00:46.52,Default,,0,0,0,,call for the reset, uh, what happens is, uh, the
Dialogue: 0,0:00:46.81,0:00:51.09,Default,,0,0,0,,course, uh, the, the course which we, uh, the school which, uh,
Dialogue: 0,0:00:51.09,0:00:54.43,Default,,0,0,0,,we deleted, uh, where the course was assigned, so that one doesn't
Dialogue: 0,0:00:54.43,0:00:55.43,Default,,0,0,0,,get added.
Dialogue: 0,0:00:56.40,0:00:59.54,Default,,0,0,0,,But when we do this, do it a second time, it is
Dialogue: 0,0:00:59.54,0:01:02.47,Default,,0,0,0,,added properly. So that is the
Dialogue: 0,0:01:02.47,0:01:07.37,Default,,0,0,0,,-- issue. One minute, one minute. So, so what is the functionality here?
Dialogue: 0,0:01:07.51,0:01:11.58,Default,,0,0,0,,What should be the functionality here? Say you you have assigned the
Dialogue: 0,0:01:11.91,0:01:16.33,Default,,0,0,0,,first you added the course to a school, then you
Dialogue: 0,0:01:16.33,0:01:21.33,Default,,0,0,0,,reassociated the school to the course to another school.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:22.19,0:01:26.87,Default,,0,0,0,,Both were created by the or added by the verifier. So
Dialogue: 0,0:01:26.87,0:01:31.22,Default,,0,0,0,,now you are uh deleting the second school.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:31.75,0:01:35.45,Default,,0,0,0,,So after deletion of the second school when you are not resetting,
Dialogue: 0,0:01:35.66,0:01:39.34,Default,,0,0,0,,so what will happen to the course? Where will it get associated
Dialogue: 0,0:01:39.34,0:01:43.54,Default,,0,0,0,,because the association is gone now for that course.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:45.91,0:01:49.69,Default,,0,0,0,,-- So what will happen? So the course in essentially gets deleted when
Dialogue: 0,0:01:49.69,0:01:50.69,Default,,0,0,0,,we delete the school.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:51.86,0:01:55.59,Default,,0,0,0,,But when we do a reset, the idea is or
Dialogue: 0,0:01:55.59,0:01:58.33,Default,,0,0,0,,-- the association gets deleted.
Dialogue: 0,0:01:59.11,0:02:00.66,Default,,0,0,0,,-- uh the course also gets deleted.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:02.43,0:02:03.43,Default,,0,0,0,,So with
Dialogue: 0,0:02:04.30,0:02:06.72,Default,,0,0,0,,this example, I mean, we can try with this one,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:06.87,0:02:08.75,Default,,0,0,0,,-- so I think.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:10.33,0:02:15.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Would it be like this, or is the, um, in a
Dialogue: 0,0:02:15.33,0:02:20.05,Default,,0,0,0,,database it is like this because the course isn't the course an
Dialogue: 0,0:02:20.05,0:02:24.92,Default,,0,0,0,,independent entity, uh, independent of the school because you
Dialogue: 0,0:02:24.92,0:02:26.88,Default,,0,0,0,,can reassociate to any school.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:27.66,0:02:28.66,Default,,0,0,0,,-- Yeah, but, uh,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:29.97,0:02:33.85,Default,,0,0,0,,hm, but, uh, where will that course uh be assigned then?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:35.00,0:02:36.00,Default,,0,0,0,,In the,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:37.63,0:02:39.67,Default,,0,0,0,,-- in the course list shouldn't it be there?
Dialogue: 0,0:02:40.55,0:02:43.94,Default,,0,0,0,,-- Uh, we can check that. Uh, we can try it. Uh, I'm,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:43.96,0:02:45.97,Default,,0,0,0,,uh, I also got confused now. Uh,
Dialogue: 0,0:02:46.83,0:02:51.52,Default,,0,0,0,,so, uh, your question is valid. I, I just, uh, got confused.
Dialogue: 0,0:02:51.71,0:02:55.89,Default,,0,0,0,,I, what is the ID? 5773.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:02.24,0:03:03.24,Default,,0,0,0,,Hm
Dialogue: 0,0:03:26.74,0:03:29.24,Default,,0,0,0,,2024. I'll select this one.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:30.88,0:03:31.97,Default,,0,0,0,,This is a test now.
Dialogue: 0,0:03:34.13,0:03:35.13,Default,,0,0,0,,And I
Dialogue: 0,0:03:54.17,0:03:57.92,Default,,0,0,0,,Currently, no schools are added by uh verified, right? So I'll add
Dialogue: 0,0:03:57.92,0:03:58.92,Default,,0,0,0,,one school.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:29.05,0:04:32.98,Default,,0,0,0,,And uh so you are allocated 100% to this project or you're
Dialogue: 0,0:04:32.98,0:04:34.26,Default,,0,0,0,,working on other project also?
Dialogue: 0,0:04:35.79,0:04:39.70,Default,,0,0,0,,-- No, I have um the, the allocation, but I don't know, but
Dialogue: 0,0:04:39.95,0:04:44.73,Default,,0,0,0,,uh I'm given some APT tasks from um AA for schools also.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:45.36,0:04:49.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Uh, I think 5656 tickets uh are there.
Dialogue: 0,0:04:50.10,0:04:53.51,Default,,0,0,0,,-- OK. So you are switching based on the tickets. Uh
Dialogue: 0,0:04:53.51,0:04:54.51,Default,,0,0,0,,-- yes.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:01.75,0:05:02.76,Default,,0,0,0,,-- OK.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:04.44,0:05:09.17,Default,,0,0,0,,So we have these courses, right? We'll select one of um course
Dialogue: 0,0:05:09.17,0:05:11.14,Default,,0,0,0,,name computer. We'll select this one.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:14.26,0:05:17.54,Default,,0,0,0,,Oh school, Academy of Computer Technology. OK.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:19.42,0:05:22.14,Default,,0,0,0,,Do a reassociation with Alaska Bible.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:25.26,0:05:26.26,Default,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:28.51,0:05:29.51,Default,,0,0,0,,I see.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:35.85,0:05:39.11,Default,,0,0,0,,Now, I need to go ahead and delete.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:40.57,0:05:43.77,Default,,0,0,0,,Firstly, we'll check if that course was added to Alaska.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:45.33,0:05:46.33,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:46.45,0:05:47.45,Default,,0,0,0,,We have
Dialogue: 0,0:05:49.05,0:05:51.57,Default,,0,0,0,,Um, to go and delete Alaska Bible.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:53.14,0:05:54.14,Default,,0,0,0,,OK.
Dialogue: 0,0:05:57.20,0:05:59.47,Default,,0,0,0,,OK. What happened to that course?
Dialogue: 0,0:06:04.97,0:06:06.89,Default,,0,0,0,,See the course also got deleted.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:09.14,0:06:11.61,Default,,0,0,0,,There's no computer courses. Now,
Dialogue: 0,0:06:12.35,0:06:15.76,Default,,0,0,0,,what I do, what I'll do is I'll click on reset.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:19.00,0:06:20.48,Default,,0,0,0,,-- So yeah Um.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:22.14,0:06:27.01,Default,,0,0,0,,Yeah, only the associated courses are there, so how, so
Dialogue: 0,0:06:27.01,0:06:28.66,Default,,0,0,0,,-- they do soft delete.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:30.82,0:06:31.82,Default,,0,0,0,,Mm.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:33.17,0:06:37.00,Default,,0,0,0,,So now I'll uh call this reset functionality.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:42.60,0:06:46.45,Default,,0,0,0,,OK. If you see, there was no computer course added, right? In
Dialogue: 0,0:06:46.45,0:06:47.83,Default,,0,0,0,,the response also you'll see.
Dialogue: 0,0:06:57.22,0:06:59.41,Default,,0,0,0,,Is it there? I don't see it.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:00.66,0:07:01.79,Default,,0,0,0,,-- This is a school name.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:02.47,0:07:04.76,Default,,0,0,0,,-- Uh, this is a school name. That is fine. Uh, we don't
Dialogue: 0,0:07:04.76,0:07:09.07,Default,,0,0,0,,see that computer course here. So now I'll do a reset again.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:13.91,0:07:15.51,Default,,0,0,0,,See, the course gets added now.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:16.86,0:07:21.73,Default,,0,0,0,,So this is the issue. You can use this ID which
Dialogue: 0,0:07:21.73,0:07:22.85,Default,,0,0,0,,is mentioned in the
Dialogue: 0,0:07:23.55,0:07:24.55,Default,,0,0,0,,Uh,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:24.42,0:07:27.54,Default,,0,0,0,,take it and try to analyze why this is happening. You got
Dialogue: 0,0:07:27.54,0:07:29.42,Default,,0,0,0,,it right. So first time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:30.22,0:07:34.45,Default,,0,0,0,,The course was not available, but 2nd time.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:35.55,0:07:36.55,Default,,0,0,0,,It is a
Dialogue: 0,0:07:39.75,0:07:42.45,Default,,0,0,0,,-- Can you please just uh reiterate the thing uh.
Dialogue: 0,0:07:45.07,0:07:49.38,Default,,0,0,0,,-- So, uh, uh, so you got the scenario, right? How, how to
Dialogue: 0,0:07:49.38,0:07:54.35,Default,,0,0,0,,reproduce this? Well, yeah, so about the reset button. So what reset
Dialogue: 0,0:07:54.35,0:07:59.01,Default,,0,0,0,,does is, so there's a separate table from where it just, uh,
Dialogue: 0,0:07:59.01,0:08:03.85,Default,,0,0,0,,takes, uh, whatever the initial data was and adds to our, uh,
Dialogue: 0,0:08:04.01,0:08:08.10,Default,,0,0,0,,uh, I mean the mod uh database. So that is what the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:08.10,0:08:12.29,Default,,0,0,0,,reset functionality does. But currently what is happening is when we click
Dialogue: 0,0:08:12.29,0:08:13.29,Default,,0,0,0,,on the reset.
Dialogue: 0,0:08:14.04,0:08:18.42,Default,,0,0,0,,And uh try to check like if the courses are
Dialogue: 0,0:08:18.42,0:08:22.98,Default,,0,0,0,,reset properly. So for the first click it is not happening, but
Dialogue: 0,0:08:22.98,0:08:26.76,Default,,0,0,0,,for the second time it is happening. The reset is working properly
Dialogue: 0,0:08:26.76,0:08:30.05,Default,,0,0,0,,for the second instance, not for the 1st. So that
Dialogue: 0,0:08:30.05,0:08:33.90,Default,,0,0,0,,-- is the we have to check the payload is going in the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:33.90,0:08:35.84,Default,,0,0,0,,first reset and the reset
Dialogue: 0,0:08:39.25,0:08:42.38,Default,,0,0,0,,-- is fine. See, in the payload we just have application here, nothing
Dialogue: 0,0:08:42.38,0:08:46.55,Default,,0,0,0,,much. Oh, OK. See, it's the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:46.55,0:08:51.55,Default,,0,0,0,,IED an application here. So, uh, basically, uh, just need
Dialogue: 0,0:08:51.55,0:08:56.35,Default,,0,0,0,,to confirm what uh is different, uh different in both the
Dialogue: 0,0:08:56.35,0:08:58.07,Default,,0,0,0,,request uh from. Uh
Dialogue: 0,0:08:59.47,0:09:01.67,Default,,0,0,0,,Uh, you can just check the locks.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:02.86,0:09:07.77,Default,,0,0,0,,So you'll find uh uh where exactly uh that particular lambda
Dialogue: 0,0:09:07.77,0:09:11.04,Default,,0,0,0,,is. I'm also not sure. So you can just go through the
Dialogue: 0,0:09:11.04,0:09:15.60,Default,,0,0,0,,code, try to check based on the uh API uh based on
Dialogue: 0,0:09:15.60,0:09:19.20,Default,,0,0,0,,this API coursework API, what exactly is going wrong.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:20.11,0:09:23.63,Default,,0,0,0,,And then you can just add a comment in the ticket uh
Dialogue: 0,0:09:23.63,0:09:28.40,Default,,0,0,0,,mentioning uh this can be the issue or uh if you
Dialogue: 0,0:09:28.40,0:09:32.59,Default,,0,0,0,,don't, don't find it, just text me like whatever your observation is.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:34.26,0:09:35.26,Default,,0,0,0,,-- OK.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:35.96,0:09:36.96,Default,,0,0,0,,-- Got it, right?
Dialogue: 0,0:09:37.20,0:09:38.20,Default,,0,0,0,,-- Mhm. Yeah.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:39.60,0:09:43.71,Default,,0,0,0,,-- OK then, uh, uh, before you log out, just, uh, uh, just
Dialogue: 0,0:09:43.71,0:09:45.54,Default,,0,0,0,,let me know. I mean, whatever.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:45.65,0:09:46.84,Default,,0,0,0,,-- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:47.73,0:09:49.17,Default,,0,0,0,,-- OK, fine. Thanks.
Dialogue: 0,0:09:50.20,0:09:51.64,Default,,0,0,0,,-- Yeah, thank you. Bye.
